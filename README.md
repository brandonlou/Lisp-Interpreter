# Blisp!

> Blisp stands for **B**randon's **lisp** or "you pro**b**ably don't want to use this **lisp**" --
whichever acronym resonates with you more.

## Overview
This lisp varient exists to serve as a practice in C programming for its creator. The codebase is
inspired by [Daniel Holden's Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/). Please check it
out if you wish to create a lisp interpreter of your own!

## Building
1. Run `make` (works for Mac and Linux)
2. Then run `./blisp`
3. Something gone wrong? `make clean` might help.

### Debugging
You may find `gdb` (`lldb` on mac), and `valgrind` useful.

## Documentation
Since blisp is simple relative to most languages, the entire language documentation will be
available here.

## Todo
* Finish the book
* Use a makefile
* Separate code into multiple files
